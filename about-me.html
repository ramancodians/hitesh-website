I had previous exposure to HTML and CSS and watching the videos and implementing the ideas prevented increased my fund of knowledge… I would give 10 STARS for the tricks he teaches for Brackets and the extensions recommended to download… Great course for a beginner……… <br> <br>

                Now on to Bootstrap……</p>

                              <p>First of all I like to thank , Hitesh. This is an awesome course from scratch. It is the best course for beginners who like to start developing apps for iOS. The way he take the course is nice and I loved it. I had gone through his youtube channel and watched all his videos without bored even it is long, and I have seen some of the iOS app development channels like stanford iOS app development etc…. But I feel this is the right place to learn many keys and topics of iOS app development. This helps the beginners to become masters soon and this is my first paid course and never worthless. — I Love iT , I Learn IT , I Rate iT — and one more thing Hitesh gives you extra than what he says.</p>
